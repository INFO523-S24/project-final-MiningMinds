To this end, we will apply the stacked model to a comlex classification problem aimed at detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.\n\n## Project Description and Motivation\n\nOur project is motivated by the goal of accurately identifying fraudulent transactions using ensemble learning approaches (baggin, boosting, and stacking). We plan to use advanced data mining and machine learning techniques to create a model capable of spotting transactions that stand out as potentially fraudulent. A key part of our project involves comparing different machine learning models to see which one performs best on each dataset we study. We're committed to understanding why certain models are more effective in specific situations. Also, we aimed to test the efficiency of Stacked Generalization, commonly known as \"stacking,\" which is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple classification or regression models via a meta-classifier or a meta-regressor. The base level models are trained based on a complete training set, then the meta-model is trained on the outputs of the base level models as features. Figure 1 illustrates the overall workflow of stacking method.\n\nThrough this work, we can make a meaningful contribution to both the field of study and the practical efforts to secure financial transactions.\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  <img src=\"images/stacking.png\" alt=\"stacking\" width=\"400\"/>\n  <figcaption>Fig 1.

This dataset is particularly appealing because of its substantial size, the anonymity of its features, and its real-world relevance. It includes 31 features: a unique transaction ID, 28 anonymized attributes (V1-V28) that could encompass various transaction details such as time, location, and merchant category, the transaction amount, and a binary class indicating whether the transaction was fraudulent. The data's anonymization ensures privacy and ethical compliance, while the binary classification makes it suitable for supervised learning approaches in fraud detection.\n\nSince the features are anonymized, it is impossbile to perform feature importance analysis, such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or permutation feature importance.\n\n::: {#load-pkgs .cell message='false' execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {#cell-load-dataset .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndf = pd.read_csv('./data/creditcard_2023.csv')\ndf.head()\n```\n\n::: {#load-dataset .cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=8}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>id</th>\n      <th>V1</th>\n      <th>V2</th>\n      <th>V3</th>\n      <th>V4</th>\n      <th>V5</th>\n      <th>V6</th>\n      <th>V7</th>\n      <th>V8</th>\n      <th>V9</th>\n      <th>...</th>\n      <th>V21</th>\n      <th>V22</th>\n      <th>V23</th>\n      <th>V24</th>\n      <th>V25</th>\n      <th>V26</th>\n      <th>V27</th>\n      <th>V28</th>\n      <th>Amount</th>\n      <th>Class</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>-0.260648</td>\n      <td>-0.469648</td>\n      <td>2.496266</td>\n      <td>-0.083724</td>\n      <td>0.129681</td>\n      <td>0.732898</td>\n      <td>0.519014</td>\n      <td>-0.130006</td>\n      <td>0.727159</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>-0.110552</td>\n      <td>0.217606</td>\n      <td>-0.134794</td>\n      <td>0.165959</td>\n      <td>0.126280</td>\n      <td>-0.434824</td>\n      <td>-0.081230</td>\n      <td>-0.151045</td>\n      <td>17982.10</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0.985100</td>\n      <td>-0.356045</td>\n      <td>0.558056</td>\n      <td>-0.429654</td>\n      <td>0.277140</td>\n      <td>0.428605</td>\n      <td>0.406466</td>\n      <td>-0.133118</td>\n      <td>0.347452</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>-0.194936</td>\n      <td>-0.605761</td>\n      <td>0.079469</td>\n      <td>-0.577395</td>\n      <td>0.190090</td>\n      <td>0.296503</td>\n      <td>-0.248052</td>\n      <td>-0.064512</td>\n      <td>6531.37</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>-0.260272</td>\n      <td>-0.949385</td>\n      <td>1.728538</td>\n      <td>-0.457986</td>\n      <td>0.074062</td>\n      <td>1.419481</td>\n      <td>0.743511</td>\n      <td>-0.095576</td>\n      <td>-0.261297</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>-0.005020</td>\n      <td>0.702906</td>\n      <td>0.945045</td>\n      <td>-1.154666</td>\n      <td>-0.605564</td>\n      <td>-0.312895</td>\n      <td>-0.300258</td>\n      <td>-0.244718</td>\n      <td>2513.54</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>-0.152152</td>\n      <td>-0.508959</td>\n      <td>1.746840</td>\n      <td>-1.090178</td>\n      <td>0.249486</td>\n      <td>1.143312</td>\n      <td>0.518269</td>\n      <td>-0.065130</td>\n      <td>-0.205698</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>-0.146927</td>\n      <td>-0.038212</td>\n      <td>-0.214048</td>\n      <td>-1.893131</td>\n      <td>1.003963</td>\n      <td>-0.515950</td>\n      <td>-0.165316</td>\n      <td>0.048424</td>\n      <td>5384.44</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>-0.206820</td>\n      <td>-0.165280</td>\n      <td>1.527053</td>\n      <td>-0.448293</td>\n      <td>0.106125</td>\n      <td>0.530549</td>\n      <td>0.658849</td>\n      <td>-0.212660</td>\n      <td>1.049921</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>-0.106984</td>\n      <td>0.729727</td>\n      <td>-0.161666</td>\n      <td>0.312561</td>\n      <td>-0.414116</td>\n      <td>1.071126</td>\n      <td>0.023712</td>\n      <td>0.419117</td>\n      <td>14278.97</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>5 rows × 31 columns</p>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {#data-overview .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Print the shape of the DataFrame\nprint(\"Shape of the DataFrame:\", df.shape)\n\n\n# Print the data types of each column\n# print(\"Data types of the columns:\")\n# print(df.dtypes)\n\n\n# Use .info() to get a concise summary of the DataFrame\nprint(\"DataFrame Information:\")\ndf.info()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nShape of the DataFrame: (568630, 31)\nDataFrame Information:\n<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\nRangeIndex: 568630 entries, 0 to 568629\nData columns (total 31 columns):\n #
